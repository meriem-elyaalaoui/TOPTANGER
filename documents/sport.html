            In Tangier, Golfing is an unmissable activity. The city's 18-hole course come from a long-standing tradition. Morocco's first golf course, founded in 1914, and designed by architects Cotton and Pennink, is today a modern course with fairways, greens and bunkers in a splendid setting. In the middle of cypresses and pines with a scent of eucalyptus, you can indulge your endless passions.
            
            On the shores of the strait, the city of Tangier also offers a large number of water activities. You’ll be also tempted to venture into the hinterland : the Rifan reliefs form a splendid setting for hiking or trekking. In these mountains, thrill and exploration are both your companions.
            
            Tangier is a picturesque and active city, where it’s enjoyable to walk and indulge in fun activities.
